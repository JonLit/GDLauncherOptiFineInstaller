# GDLauncherOptiFineInstaller
OptiFine Intaller for GDLauncher

I wanted to install OptiFine for an instance of GDLauncher, but I had some trouble with it.
Now it works, and I wanted to make a program that automatically does all required steps to install OptiFine for an instance of GDLauncher

What you still need to do:

1. Download OptiFine from www.optifine.net/downloads
2. run the downloaded .jar file and select "Extract"
3. open this Program (GDLauncherOptiFineInstaller)
4. type the OptiFine Version into the TextField
5. select the extracted OptiFine.jar File
6. select your GDLauncher User Data Path
7. Press Install ;)

You can find the Location of your GDLauncher User Data Path in GDLauncher's Settings
