# GDLauncherOptiFineInstaller
OptiFine Intaller for GDLauncher

I wanted to install OptiFine for an instance of GDLauncher, but I had some trouble with it.
Now it works, and I wanted to make a program that automatically does all required steps to install OptiFine for an instance of GDLauncher

What you still need to do:

1. Download OptiFine from www.optifine.net/downloads
2. run the downloaded .jar file and select "Extract"
3. open this Program (GDLauncherOptiFineInstaller)
4. select the extracted OptiFine.jar File
5. select your `.minecraft` Folder
6. select your GDLauncher User Data Path

You can find the `.minecraft` Folder in these Locations:
  On Windows: `C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\.minecraft`
  On Linux:   `~/.minecraft/`
  On MacOS:   `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft`

You can find the Location of your GDLauncher User Data Path in GDLauncher's Settings
